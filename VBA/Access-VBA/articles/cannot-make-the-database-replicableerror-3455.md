# Cannot make the database replicable. (Error 3455)

  

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

The Microsoft Access database engine was in the process of making the database replicable. The operation failed because there were insufficient resources. Make sure the total number of fields after replication does not exceed 255 in a single table and the total number of bytes in a record does not exceed 2048.
