# Report Section

  

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

A report section is part of a report such as a header, footer, or detail section.

You can set report section properties that are attributes of a report which affect the appearance or behavior of a specific section. For example, you can set the  **CanGrow** property to specify whether the section will increase vertically to print all the data the section contains. Section properties are set in report Design view.
