# Cannot modify table structure. Another user has the table open. (Error 3422)

  

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

The Microsoft Access database engine was unable to modify the structure of a table because another user currently has the table open. Wait until the table is closed, and then try making your changes again.
