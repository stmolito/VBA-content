# SQL Specific Query

  

**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Access 2016

An SQL specific query is one that can be created only by writing an SQL statement in SQL view. Union, pass-through, and data definition queries are SQL specific queries.



|**SQL specific query type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|Union|An SQL specific select query that combines corresponding fields from two or more tables or queries into one field. For example, a union query of the Customers table and the Suppliers table results in a snapshot that contains all the specified records from both the Customers table and the Suppliers table.|
|Pass-Through|An SQL specific query that sends commands directly to an SQL database server (such as Microsoft SQL Server). With pass-through queries, you work with the tables on the server instead of linking the tables to your Microsoft Access database.|
|Data Definition|An SQL specific query that can create or delete an index, or create, alter, or delete a table.|
