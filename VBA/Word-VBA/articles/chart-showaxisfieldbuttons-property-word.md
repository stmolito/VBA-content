# Chart.ShowAxisFieldButtons Property (Word)

Returns or sets whether to display axis field buttons on a PivotChart. Read/write. Depcrecated.


## Syntax

 _expression_ . **ShowAxisFieldButtons**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **[Chart](chart-object-word.md)** object.


## Remarks

This object or member is part of the shared chart object model infrastructure between Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint and is not meant to be called directly from your code. Reading or setting this property causes a run-time error. In Word, you cannot create a PivotChart and copying or pasting a valid PivotChart from Microsoft Excel to a Word document will convert the PivotChart to a Chart.
