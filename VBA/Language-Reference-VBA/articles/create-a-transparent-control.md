# Create a transparent control




1. Put the basic control onto the form.
    
2. View the control's properties.
    
3. Set the  **BackStyle** property to **Transparent**.
    
4. If the control supports the  **BorderStyle** property, set it to **None**.
    




 **Note**  When you make a control transparent, the background color does not display, so the  **BackColor** property is ignored. However, the setting for **BackColor** is not changed when a control is transparent.
