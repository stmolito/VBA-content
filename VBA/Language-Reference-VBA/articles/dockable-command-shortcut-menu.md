# Dockable Command (Shortcut Menu)

Toggles the ability to dock the active window on and off.

A window is docked when it is attached or "anchored" to one edge of the screen, application window, or another dockable window. When you move a dockable window, it "snaps" to the location. A window is not dockable when you can move it anywhere on the screen and leave it there.
