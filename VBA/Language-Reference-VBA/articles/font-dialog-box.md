- Bold — Boldface
    
- Italic — Italic

 **Size**

Lists common point sizes for the highlighted font. When the box first appears, the point size for the font already in use for the selected element is highlighted, and the highlighted point size appears in the edit box at the top.

You can select directly from the list or type the new point size in the edit box at the top (if you know that you have additional sizes installed for the currently selected printer or if you are using scalable type).

Lists two additional options that you can use for highlighting the selected font.




- Strikeout — Prints the strikeout character across the font
    
- Underline — Underlines the font You may select as many of the Effects as you wish.
