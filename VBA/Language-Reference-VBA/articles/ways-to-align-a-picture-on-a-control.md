# Ways to align a picture on a control

The  **Picture** property assigns a bitmap or other picture to a control. After you assign the picture to the control, you can do any of the following to align the picture on the control:



- Use the  **PictureAlignment** property to center the picture within the **Image** or align any corner of the picture with the corresponding corner of the **Image**.
    
- Use the  **PictureSizeMode** property to clip, stretch, or zoom the picture within the **Image**. Stretching can distort the picture, but zooming will not.
    
- Use the  **PictureTiling** property to display multiple copies of the picture within the **Image**.
