# Expected user-defined type, not project

There is no [user-defined type](vbe-glossary.md) by this name in the current[scope](vbe-glossary.md), but there is a [project](vbe-glossary.md) by this name. You can define a[variable](vbe-glossary.md) as having user-defined type, but not project type. This error has the following cause and solution:



- The name of a project is used as a user-defined type. Check the spelling of the name of the user-defined type, and make sure the user-defined type isn't private to another [module](vbe-glossary.md).
