Updates the display by redrawing the form or page.
 **Syntax**
 _Boolean_ = _object_. **Repaint**
The  **Repaint** method syntax has these parts:


|**Part**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
| _object_|Required. A valid object.|
 **Remarks**
The  **Repaint** method is useful if the contents or appearance of an object changes significantly, and you don't want to wait until the system automatically repaints the area.
