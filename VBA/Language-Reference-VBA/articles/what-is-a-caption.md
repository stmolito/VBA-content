# What is a caption?

A caption is descriptive text that appears directly on or around a control. The following controls can have captions:  **CheckBox**, **CommandButton**, **Frame**, **Label**, **OptionButton**, and **ToggleButton**. The **Page** and **Tab** objects that are part of the **MultiPage** and **TabStrip** also can have captions.
