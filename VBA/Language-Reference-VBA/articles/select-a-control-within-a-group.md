# Select a control within a group




1. Select the group.
    
2. Select a single control within the group. The sizing handles around the group become lighter, and dark handles appear on the selected control. You can change the value of the selected control's properties. Any changes you make will affect only the selected control.
    
3. When you're finished working with the selected control, click anywhere inside the group, but not on the selected control. The group is still selected. You can select another control in the group or go on to any other task you need to perform.
