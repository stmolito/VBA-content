# For Each control variable must be Variant or Object

A control [variable](vbe-glossary.md) is the _element_ part of the **For Each...Next** statement syntax. This error has the following causes and solutions:



- A [collection](vbe-glossary.md) has a control variable that isn't a **Variant** or **Object** type.
    
    Make sure the  _element_ part of the **For Each...Next** is a **Variant** or **Object**.
    
- An [array](vbe-glossary.md) has a control variable that isn't a **Variant**.
    
    Make sure the  _element_ part of the **For Each...Next** is a **Variant**.
