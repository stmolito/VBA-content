There are restrictions in procedure-naming beyond the rules for naming [identifiers](vbe-glossary.md). This error has the following cause and solution:


- [procedure](vbe-glossary.md)[host application](vbe-glossary.md)
    
    Choose another name for the procedure.
    
- Your procedure name is that of a restricted keyword, exceeds 255 characters, or doesn't begin with a letter. Choose a different name for the procedure.
    

For additional information, select the item in question and press F1 (in Windows) or HELP (on the Macintosh).
