# What is a ToolTip?

A ToolTip is a short description, usually just a few words, that appears when the user holds the mouse pointer briefly over a control or another part of the user interface without clicking. You can customize ToolTips for controls and for the Toolbox.

The default value for a new control that is copied from a form to the Toolbox is "New" followed by the control type. For example, the default ToolTip for a customized CommandButton (such as OK) is "New CommandButton". If a control has no associated ToolTip, "Unknown" is the default value.

 **Note**  The ToolTip is information provided by Microsoft Forms to forms developers in design mode. Each control has a property,  **ControlTipText**, that allows forms developers to give a "ToolTip" to end users while the application is running.
