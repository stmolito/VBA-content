# Move an item to another Toolbox page




1. Select a control on any page of the Toolbox.
    
2. Drag the control to the tab of the new page. Hold the mouse pointer over the tab until the page appears at the front of the Toolbox.
    
3. Drag the control onto the main region of the page.
    




 **Note**  If the page you want to place the control on is not visible, you can increase the width of the Toolbox to display tabs for all the pages, and then drag the control to the appropriate page.
