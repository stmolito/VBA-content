# Looping Through Code

Using conditional statements and looping statements (also called control structures), you can write Visual Basic code that makes decisions and repeats actions. Another useful control structure, the  **With** statement, lets you to run a series of statements without having to requalify an [object](vbe-glossary.md).


## Using Conditional Statements to Make Decisions

Conditional statements evaluate whether a condition is  **True** or **False**, and then specify one or more statements to run, depending on the result. Usually, a condition is an [expression](vbe-glossary.md) that uses a [comparison operator](vbe-glossary.md) to compare one value or [variable](vbe-glossary.md) with another.


## Choosing a Conditional Statement to Use




- [If...Then...Else](using-ifthenelse-statements.md): Branching when a condition is  **True** or **False**
    
- [Select Case](using-select-case-statements.md): Selecting a branch from a set of conditions
    



## Using Loops to Repeat Code

Looping allows you to run a group of statements repeatedly. Some loops repeat statements until a condition is  **False**; others repeat statements until a condition is **True**. There are also loops that repeat statements a specific number of times or for each object in a [collection](vbe-glossary.md).


## Choosing a Loop to Use




- [Do...Loop](using-doloop-statements.md): Looping while or until a condition is  **True**
    
- [For...Next](using-fornext-statements.md): Using a counter to run statements a specified number of times
    
- [For Each...Next](using-for-eachnext-statements.md): Repeating a group of statements for each object in a collection
    



## Running Several Statements on the Same Object

In Visual Basic, usually you must specify an object before you can run one of its [methods](vbe-glossary.md) or change one of its [properties](vbe-glossary.md). You can use the  **With** statement to specify an object once for an entire series of statements.




- [With](using-with-statements.md): Running a series of statements on the same object
