# Expected variable or procedure, not project

There is no [variable](vbe-glossary.md) or[procedure](vbe-glossary.md) by this name in the current[scope](vbe-glossary.md), but there is a [project](vbe-glossary.md) by this name. This error has the following cause and solution:



- The name of a project is used as a variable or procedure. Check the spelling of the variable or procedure name, and make sure the name you want to refer to isn't private to another [module](vbe-glossary.md). A project name can be a qualifier, but can't stand alone.
