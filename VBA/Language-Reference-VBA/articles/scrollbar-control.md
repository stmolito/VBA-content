# ScrollBar Control



Returns or sets the value of another control based on the position of the scroll box.
 **Remarks**
A  **ScrollBar** is a stand-alone control you can place on a form. It is visually like the scroll bar you see in certain objects such as a **ListBox** or the drop-down portion of a **ComboBox**. However, unlike the scroll bars in these examples, the stand-alone **ScrollBar** is not an integral part of any other control.
To use the  **ScrollBar** to set or read the value of another control, you must write code for the **ScrollBar's** events and methods. For example, to use the **ScrollBar** to update the value of a **TextBox**, you can write code that reads the **Value** property of the **ScrollBar** and then sets the **Value** property of the **TextBox**.
The default property for a  **ScrollBar** is the **Value** property.
The default event for a  **ScrollBar** is the Change event.

 **Note**  To create a horizontal or vertical  **ScrollBar**, drag the sizing handles of the **ScrollBar** horizontally or vertically on the form.
