# #ElseIf must be preceded by a matching #If or #ElseIf and followed by an #ElseIf, #Else, or #End If

# **ElseIf** is a conditional compilation directive. This error has the following causes and solutions:



- An # **ElseIf** has been detected that isn't preceded by an # **If** or # **ElseIf**. Place an # **If** statement before the # **ElseIf** or remove an incorrectly placed preceding # **End If**.
    
- An # **ElseIf** has been detected that is preceded by an # **Else** or # **End If**. Appropriately terminate the preceding # **If** block, or change the preceding # **Else** to an # **ElseIf**.
    

For additional information, select the item in question and press F1 (in Windows) or HELP (on the Macintosh).
