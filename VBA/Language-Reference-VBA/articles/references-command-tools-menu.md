# References Command (Tools Menu)

Displays the  **References** dialog box. This dialog box allows you to add an[object library](vbe-glossary.md) or[type library](vbe-glossary.md) reference to your project. This makes another application's objects available in your code. Once a reference is set, the referenced objects are displayed in the[Object Browser](vbe-glossary.md).

You can also add references to other loaded and saved projects. If a project has not been saved, it appears as "UNSAVED: <ProjectName>" and you will be unable to make a reference to it.

Only available at [design time](vbe-glossary.md).
