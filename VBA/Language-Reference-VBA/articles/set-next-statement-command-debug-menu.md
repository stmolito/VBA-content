# Set Next Statement Command (Debug Menu)

Sets the execution point to the line of code you choose. You can set a different line of code to execute after the currently selected statement by selecting the line of code you want to execute and choosing the  **Set** **Next** **Statement** command or by dragging the Current Execution Line margin indicator to the line of code you want to execute.

Using  **Set** **Next** **Statement**, you can choose a line of code located before or after the currently selected statement. When you run the code, any intervening code isn't executed. Use this command when you want to rerun a statement within the current procedure or to skip over statements you don't want to execute. You can't use **Set** **Next** **Statement** for statements in different procedures.
