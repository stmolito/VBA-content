# Zoom Property



Specifies how much to change the size of a displayed object.
 **Syntax**
 _object_. **Zoom** [= _Integer_ ]
The  **Zoom** property syntax has these parts:


|**Part**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
| _object_|Required. A valid object.|
| _Integer_|Optional. The percentage to increase or decrease the displayed image.|
 **Remarks**
The value of the  **Zoom** property specifies a percentage of image enlargement or reduction by which an image display should change. Values from 10 to 400 are valid. The value specified is a percentage of the object's original size; thus, a setting of 400 means you want to enlarge the image to four times its original size (or 400 percent), while a setting of 10 means you want to reduce the image to one-tenth of its original size (or 10 percent).
