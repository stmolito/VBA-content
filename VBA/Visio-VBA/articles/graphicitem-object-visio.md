# GraphicItem Object (Visio)

Represents a single component part of a data graphic master (a  **[Master](master-object-visio.md)** object of type **visTypeDataGraphic** ) that is responsible for a specific graphical adornment of the master.


 **Note**  This Visio object or member is available only to licensed users of Visio Professional 2013.


## Remarks

The default property of a  **GraphicItem** object is **[ID](graphicitem-id-property-visio.md)** .

 **GraphicItem** objects can be of four types:




- Color by value
    
- Data bar
    
- Icon set
    
- Text callout
    


You cannot create or significantly modify  **GraphicItem** objects programmaticallyâ€”you must perform these tasks in the Visio user interface (UI). For more information about creating and modifying data graphics in the UI, search for "data graphic" in Visio end-user Help.

However, the properties and methods listed below do permit some programmatic modification of  **GraphicItem** objects. In particular, you can modify the position of a graphic item relative to the shape or selection it's associated with; the Z-order (the order in which Visio draws graphic items) of a **GraphicItem** object in the **[GraphicItems](graphicitems-object-visio.md)** collection; and the expression (value) used to evaluate a graphic item against the rule that determines how it is displayed.

Use the  **[DataGraphic](graphicitem-datagraphic-property-visio.md)** property to get the **Master** object of type **visTypeDataGraphic** that contains the **GraphicItem** object.

Use the  **[GetExpression](graphicitem-getexpression-method-visio.md)** method to get the current expression against which the graphic item's rule is evaluated.

Use the  **[SetExpression](graphicitem-setexpression-method-visio.md)** method to set the current expression against which the graphic item's rule is evaluated.

Use the  **[Delete](graphicitem-delete-method-visio.md)** method to delete a **GraphicItem** object from the **[GraphicItems](graphicitems-object-visio.md)** collection.

Use the  **[HorizontalPosition](graphicitem-horizontalposition-property-visio.md)** property to get or set the horizontal position of the graphic item relative to the shape or selection that it's associated with.

Use the  **[VerticalPosition](graphicitem-verticalposition-property-visio.md)** property to get or set thevertical position of the graphic item relative to the shape or selection that it's associated with.

Use the  **[UseDataGraphicPosition](graphicitem-usedatagraphicposition-property-visio.md)** property to get or set whether a **GraphicItem** object inherits the settings of the **[DataGraphicHorizontalPosition](master-datagraphichorizontalposition-property-visio.md)** and **[DataGraphicVerticalPosition](master-datagraphicverticalposition-property-visio.md)** properties of the data graphic master it belongs to (when set to **True)** , or whether the **GraphicItem** object's own **HorizontalPosition** and **Vertical Position** settings are applied (when set to **False** ).
