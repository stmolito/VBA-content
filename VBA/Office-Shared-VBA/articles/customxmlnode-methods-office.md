# CustomXMLNode Methods (Office)

## Methods



|**Name**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|[AppendChildNode](customxmlnode-appendchildnode-method-office.md)|Appends a single node as the last child under the context element node in the tree. |
|[AppendChildSubtree](customxmlnode-appendchildsubtree-method-office.md)|Adds a subtree as the last child under the context element node in the tree.|
|[Delete](customxmlnode-delete-method-office.md)|Deletes the current node from the tree (including all of its children, if any exist).|
|[HasChildNodes](customxmlnode-haschildnodes-method-office.md)|Gets  **True** if the current element node has child element nodes.|
|[InsertNodeBefore](customxmlnode-insertnodebefore-method-office.md)|Inserts a new node just before the context node in the tree.|
|[InsertSubtreeBefore](customxmlnode-insertsubtreebefore-method-office.md)|Inserts the specified subtree into the location just before the context node. |
|[RemoveChild](customxmlnode-removechild-method-office.md)|Removes the specified child node from the tree.|
|[ReplaceChildNode](customxmlnode-replacechildnode-method-office.md)|Removes the specified child node (and its subtree) from the main tree, and replaces it with a different node in the same location.|
|[ReplaceChildSubtree](customxmlnode-replacechildsubtree-method-office.md)|Removes the specified node (and its subtree) from the main tree, and replaces it with a different subtree in the same location.|
|[SelectNodes](customxmlnode-selectnodes-method-office.md)|Selects a collection of nodes matching an XPath expression. This method differs from the  **CustomXMLPart**. **SelectNodes** method in that the XPath expression will be evaluated starting with the 'expression' node as the context node.|
|[SelectSingleNode](customxmlnode-selectsinglenode-method-office.md)|Selects a single node from a collection matching an XPath expression. This method differs from the  **CustomXMLPart**. **SelectSingleNode** method in that the XPath expression will be evaluated starting with the 'expression' node as the context node.|
