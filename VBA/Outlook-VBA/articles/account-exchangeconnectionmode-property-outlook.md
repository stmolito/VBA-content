# Account.ExchangeConnectionMode Property (Outlook)

Returns an  **[OlExchangeConnectionMode](olexchangeconnectionmode-enumeration-outlook.md)** constant that indicates the current connection mode for the Microsoft Exchange Server that hosts the account mailbox. Read-only


## Syntax

 _expression_ . **ExchangeConnectionMode**

 _expression_ A variable that represents an **[Account](account-object-outlook.md)** object.
