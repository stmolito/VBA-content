## Syntax

## Example

The following Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) example obtains a  **[View](view-object-outlook.md)** object by using the **[CurrentView](explorer-currentview-property-outlook.md)** property of the **[Explorer](explorer-object-outlook.md)** object, then sets the **[Filter](view-filter-property-outlook.md)** property of the **View** object to display only those Outlook items that were received last week.


```vb
Private Sub FilterViewToLastWeek() 
 
 Dim objView As View 
 
 
 
 ' Obtain a View object reference to the current view. 
 
 Set objView = Application.ActiveExplorer.CurrentView 
 
 
 
 ' Set a DASL filter string, using a DASL macro, to show 
 
 ' only those items that were received last week. 
 
 objView.Filter = "%lastweek(""urn:schemas:httpmail:datereceived"")%" 
 
 
 
 ' Save and apply the view. 
 
 objView.Save 
 
 objView.Apply
